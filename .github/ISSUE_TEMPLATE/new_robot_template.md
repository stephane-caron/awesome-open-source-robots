Hi there! Here is a proposal to add the open source robot ``<robot_name>`` ðŸ¤–

* [ ] I have checked that the build is open ([guidelines](https://github.com/tasts-robots/us/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))
* [ ] I have checked that the software to control the robot is open ([guidelines](https://github.com/tasts-robots/us/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))

Relevant information about the robot:

* Type: (Hexapod, Humanoid, Manipulator, Quadruped, ...)
* License: (SPDX identifier of permissive or copyleft license, e.g. CC-BY-4.0, GPL-3.0, ...)
* Build instructions: (link to open build instructions)
* Model: (link to URDF, MJCF, ...)
* Software: (link to the open source software for motion control)

Icing on the cake, here is a picture for the gallery:

Robotically,
